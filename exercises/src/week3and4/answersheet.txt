DESIGN PATTERNS EXERCISES

1. 
	(a) Interfaces allow for default methods which can be used when directly instantiated (for 
		example using an anonymous class) while	abstract classes must be extended by a sub-class
		before any of its methods can be used.
		
		public interface Greeting {
			default String sayHello() {
				return "Hello";
			}
		}
		public class Greet {
			public static void main (String[] args) {
				Greeting myGreeting = new Greeting() {};
				System.out.print(myGreeting.sayHello());
		
			}
		}
	
	(b) Interfaces permit multiple inheritance, abstract classes only one (extends)
		
		public class A extends B, implements C, D {...}
		
	(c) Abstract classes may hold state information, interfaces may not.
		
		public abstract class A {
			public static final int ANSWER = 42;
		 	...
		}
		
2.
	(a) false, marker interfaces such as Serializable have no methods
	(b) false, interfaces cannot have any member fields
	(c) false, interfaces cannot contain constructors
	
3.	java.util.Observable

4.	It allows one to implement an interface without having to implement all the methods.

5. One can use a private constructor as in the following example using eager initialization.

	public class SingletonClass {

    	private static SingletonClass singletonInstance = new SingletonClass();

    	private SingletonClass() {}

    	public static SingletonClass getSingletonInstance() {
        	return singletonInstance;
    	}
	}
  	
 6.	Lazy-initialization is used for faster start-ups as it provides the object just in time.
 
 	public class SingleTonClass {
   		private static SingleTonClass obj=null;
   		
   		private SingleTonClass() {}
   		
   		public static SingleTonClass objectCreationMethod() {
			if(obj==null){
	    	obj= new SingleTonClass();
		}
        return obj;
  	   
  	   public static void main(String args[]){
			SingleTonClass myobject= SingleTonClass.objectCreationMethod();
		}
  	}
